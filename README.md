# Speech-Recognition

This project involves building multi-speaker speech recognition for 41 words and phrase combinations of different lengths using the [Hidden Markov Models](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/mjfg_NOW.pdf) and the hyperparameter optimization of the outcome of the built-in models.

The result of the log argmax on the *Train* and unseen *Test* setes are **96.97%** and **96.21%**, accordingly. This indicates that the method has a good generalization
